Input–Output and Interrupt
 Example:

 • The branch instruction at address 1 causes the program 
to transfer to the input–output service program at 
address 1120.
 • This program checks the flags, determines which flag is 
set, and then transfers the required input or output 
information. Once this is done, the instruction ION is 
executed to set IEN to 1 (to enable further interrupts), 
and the program returns to the location where it was 
interrupted.
 • The instruction that returns the computer to the original 
place in the main program is a branch indirect 
instruction with an address part of 0. 
• This instruction is placed at the end of the I/O service 
program.
